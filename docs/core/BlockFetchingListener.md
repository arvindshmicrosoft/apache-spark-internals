# BlockFetchingListener

`BlockFetchingListener` is the <<contract, contract>> of <<implementations, EventListeners>> that want to be notified about <<onBlockFetchSuccess, onBlockFetchSuccess>> and <<onBlockFetchFailure, onBlockFetchFailure>>.

BlockFetchingListener is used when:

* storage:ShuffleClient.md#fetchBlocks[ShuffleClient], storage:BlockTransferService.md#fetchBlocks[BlockTransferService], storage:NettyBlockTransferService.md#fetchBlocks[NettyBlockTransferService], and storage:ExternalShuffleClient.md#fetchBlocks[ExternalShuffleClient] are requested to fetch a sequence of blocks

* `BlockFetchStarter` is requested to core:BlockFetchStarter.md#createAndStart[createAndStart]

* core:RetryingBlockFetcher.md[] and storage:OneForOneBlockFetcher.md[] are created
